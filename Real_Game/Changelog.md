 - Finished introduction - January 8th, 2020
 
   - List of things that need to be tested
   
      - Player friendlyness
      
      - if the controls/commands were easy to understand
      
      - how easy it is to understand the story
      
      - if spelling errors are there
      
 
 - Had people test the game - January 10th, 2020

   - Spelling errors were fixed and more explenation of the controls

   - Hayley did not like the game because she didn't like how you have to type
   everything instead of just pressing a button
   
   - Morgan did not like it, felt it was too rescriting to actually have to
   go to school

   - to summarize, they are not a huge fan of games

 - Had my mom and sister test my game - January 12th 2020
 
   - More spelling mistakes... pointed out that at some points you can always
   quit and that the map portion spawned you at the wrong point when you walk
   into a wall or wrong class
   
   - Kaylen actually liked it but thought it wasn't long enough
   
   - My mom found the map portion to be difficult to navigate because of the
   coordinate system
   
   - to summarize, the game was made a pit longer but I did not change the map
   part because it actually isn't that confusing
